# MCML

Last update: 3/1/2000

MCML is a Monte Carlo simulation program for Multi-layered Turbid
Media with an infinitely narrow photon beam as the light source. The
simulation is specified by an input text file called, for example,
"sample.mci", which can be altered by any simple text editor.  The
output is another text file called, for example, "sample.mco". (The
names are arbitrary.)

CONV is a convolution program which uses the MCML output file to
convolve for photon beams of variable size or shape (Gaussian or flat
field).  CONV can provide a variety of output formats (reflectance,
transmission, iso-fluence contours, etc.) which are compatible with
standard graphics applications.
